# GoogleAuth

This package is based on https://github.com/wstrange/GoogleAuth
(which is opened source under [BSD-3-Clause License](https://github.com/wstrange/GoogleAuth/blob/master/LICENSE))
and modified to be fit in Keel, including reimplemented Base32 Encoding.

> GoogleAuth is a Java server library that implements the Time-based One-time Password (TOTP) algorithm specified in
> RFC6238.

>
> This implementation borrows from Google Authenticator, whose C code has served as a reference, and was created upon
> code published in this blog post by Enrico M. Crisostomo.
