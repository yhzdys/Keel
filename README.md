## Dry Dock of Keel

Consider to use [Dry Dock of Keel](https://github.com/sinri/DryDockOfKeel) to build an application quickly!

I started a project to provide lession around how to startup with DryDock, including
Keel: https://github.com/sinri/DryDockLession :)

## Branches

* latest: the latest pushed version of Keel, may not be released yet.
* p3: the latest released version of Keel 3.x.

## Migration

### From 3.1.x to 3.2.x

* Rebuilt logging implementation.
  * The `KeelIssueRecord*` becomes the base realization.
  * The `KeelEventLog*` are kept but reimplemented above `KeelIssueRecord*`.
  * Refined the classed that use logging.
* Provided `KeelMetrixRecord*` functions.

### From 3.0.x to 3.1.x

* The `KeelHelpers` becomes a static member of class `KeelHelpersInterface`.
* The `Keel` becomes a static member of class `KeelInstance` as its instance. Originally it was a class.
  * The `Keel` now also inherits the class `KeelHelpersInterface`. So you may not need `KeelHelpers` while `Keel` used.
* MySQL
  * Data source should be defined as `NamedMySQLDataSource`.
  * The raw `SqlConnection` instance should be used in a defined `NamedMySQLConnection`.
  * `DynamicNamedMySQLConnection` is also available for convenience.
